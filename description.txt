COVIDJournal App

SHORT
A simple app to manage your contacts, and notifies you when to take a test.

LONG
In this app we want to tackle a problem so many people have. How do I keep track of my contacts, while
keeping my privacy safe? COVIDJournal makes it easier for everyone to do just that. All you have to do,
is to add your friends and family, and if either your or them get tested positive, the contacts will 
get notified.

We have no affiliation with any government, although you can use the information on the app, to let 
the authorities know what you have been doing in order to trace the coronavirus.

COVIDJournal will also provide you with news and statistics of each country, to keep you aware of how 
the world is responding to the coronavirus pandemic.

We work with Google to keep your data secure and reliable. 

Track the coronavirus and save lives.
