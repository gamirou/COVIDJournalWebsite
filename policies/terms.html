    <h4>Terms &amp; Conditions</h4> <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will
        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
        allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
        our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
        extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
        versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
        database rights and other intellectual property rights related
        to it, still belong to George Sima.
      </p> <p>
        George Sima is committed to ensuring that the app is
        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p> <p>
        The COVID Journal app stores and processes personal data that
        you have provided to us, in order to provide my
        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
        that the COVID Journal app won’t work properly or at all.
      </p> <div><p>
          The app does use third party services that declare their own
          Terms and Conditions.
        </p> <p>

          providers used by the app

        You should be aware that there are certain things that
        George Sima will not take responsibility for. Certain
        functions of the app will require the app to have an active
        internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
        by your mobile network provider, but George Sima
        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
        have any of your data allowance left.
      </p> <p></p> <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
        should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
        other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
        responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
        (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
      </p> <p>
        Along the same lines, George Sima cannot always take
        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
        battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
        George Sima cannot accept responsibility.
      </p> <p>
        With respect to George Sima’s responsibility for your
        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you. George Sima accepts no liability for any
        loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
        relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p> <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
        currently available on Android – the requirements for
        system(and for any additional systems we
        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
        using the app. George Sima does not promise that it
        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the Android version that you have
        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
        (b) you must stop using the app, and delete it. Then, contact me
        at <a href="mailto:hello@covidjournal.net">hello@covidjournal.net</a>
        so we can delete your data from our database.
        from your device.
      </p> <p>
        If you use the app for malicious purposes, we will terminate your 
        account immediately, we will delete your data from our servers and
        we will take legal action if it affects us, other users or our 
        servers.
      </p><p><h4>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h4></p> <p>
        I may update our Terms and Conditions
        from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will
